# Deployment Lab
In this lab you will build a landing page (HTML, CSS, NodeJS) and deploy it to AWS.

## Introduction
For today’s lab, you are going to create a landing page. Landing pages are usually for when users click on ads. They are taken to a landing page that tries to get them to buy something or sign up for something – it’s all about taking action. Feel free to make a landing page about an existing product/service (a book, video game, piano lessons, plants, window washing etc.) or make something up (feel free to be silly).

## Instructions
### Setup
To start off, setup your basic HTML template and add an `h1` tag (for testing purposes, so it can say anything, you’ll change/remove it later). Then get your `express` server setup to render your HTML page.

At this point, get your page deployed to an EC2 instance.

#### Sections to Skip

1. You can skip the AWS account setup since you’ll have completed that during the demo.

2. You can also skip creating a new security group – you can use the one you made during the demo.

Once you have your page successfully deployed, come back and build out your HTML & CSS. As you progress, add a single ‘feature’ at a time, and then redeploy. For example:

- Add a header and an image

- Redeploy

- Add description

- Redeploy

- Add CSS

- Redeploy

These are just some examples, make this page your own! But, remember, one of the main objectives for this lab is to practice deployment to a hosting service like AWS EC2.

### Going Further
There is no limit to the landing page, so it should take you all the way through the end of the day. If you’re looking for more ideas:

- Try adding API endpoints to it! Can your server handle serving static files and data?

- Start with a new app from scratch and set up a new instance

- Can you connect a database to your app?
